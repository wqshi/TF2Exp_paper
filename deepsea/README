#In this directory, we use DeepSEA (v0.63) to calculate the variation impact on TF binding.

#In the ENCODE called peaks, some peak can have multiple peakmax position, some peaks are overlaped.
#We reprocess the peaks so that each peak region is only assigned to one peakMax position.
p_preprocess_encode_peaks.py


##Run DeepSEA for the called variants
p_rundeepsea.py.
#This script is modified based on the DeepSEA script. The difference is that the 
#impact of variant is calculated based on the peak max position of the region.
