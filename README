Predicting the impact of altered TF binding on gene expression based on cis-regulatory variants

#Overall structure of the code:

./deepsea/: scripts to calcualte the variantion impact on TF binding
./sailfish/: quantify the expression based on RNA-seq for each individual.
./python/: for each gene, collect the altered TF binding events for model training.
./R/: for each gene, build a regression model to predict gene expression based on the altered TF binding events

For more details, check the README file in each directory.
