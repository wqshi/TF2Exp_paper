s_batch_run.sh: run the regression models on one chromosome. 
The core is to run the s_run_single_gene.sh



Compare the selected features in two models (TF and SNPinTF): r_linkage_analysis.R



The GO enrichment and well predict gene analysis: s_summary_regression_results.R



s_summary_regression_features.R:
* Most freuqent selected features
* Compare the features in promoter and enhancer interms of coefficient, distance
* A fihser stats for the enriched features.


s_summary_regression_results.R:
* Multiple plots of the manuscript.

s_cmp_rnaseq_microarray.R:


Mircroarray data preprocess:
s_merge_800samples_expression.R


Tests of preprecessing and check the variant in TF peaks (common variants and rare variants ratio in the peaks):
s_find_variants_in_key_features.R



Compare the key feature changes between TF and TF-SNP models.
s_check_features_of_one_gene.R
